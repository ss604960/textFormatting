<h1>Indents and Spans</h1>
<div id="intro" class="instructions">
Add css rules to make the text below match the pictured academic essay format. To accomplish this: 
<ol>
	<li>Set a vertical margin of 0 and an appropriate horizontal margin for the essay and worksCited sections (try to eyeball a good estimate and then adjust until you get it right</li>
	<li>Strip the margins from paragraphs (p tags) inside of the essay section and use a text-indent rule to set an appropriate first line indent. You can set text indent in pixels, em, or percent. Which do you think would be best to use?</li>
	<li>Set the line-height rule for p tags inside of the essay section to achieve the "double spaced" appearance shown. Remember that the em unit is the size of a capital letter in the current font. Given that a double spaced paragraph has enough room for another line of text (including capital letters) between each line, you should be able to figure out the right em value for line-height pretty easily!</li>
	<li>Set a negative text-indent for paragraps in the worksCited section to achieve the hanging-indent. Then adjust the left margin for these paragraps to move them back into alignment with the other text (note: if you think about how the negative indent moved the text on the page, you should be able to easily compute the correct left margin to move things back).</li>
	<li>Add a color rule for the class note to change the color of the first note, note [2]. Choose something sensible. Then apply span tags with the class note to the other notes in the text. Using span tags allows you to apply any aribtrary styling you want to inline text.</li>
</ol>
Once you have replicated the pictured design, try experimenting with some spans and other rules and see what sorts of other formats you can achieve.

<h2>Global Warming</h2>
<p>Global warming is the observed century-scale rise in the average temperature of Earth's climate system.<span class="note">[2]</span> Since 1971, 90% of the increased energy has been stored in the oceans, mostly in the 0 to 700m region.[3] Despite the oceans' dominant role in energy storage, the term "global warming" is also used to refer to increases in average temperature of the air and sea at Earth's surface.[4] Since the early 20th century, the global air and sea surface temperature has increased about 0.8 °C (1.4 °F), with about two-thirds of the increase occurring since 1980.[5] Each of the last three decades has been successively warmer at the Earth's surface than any preceding decade since 1850.[6]</p>

<p>Scientific understanding of the cause of global warming has been increasing. In its fourth assessment (AR4 2007) of the relevant scientific literature, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reported that scientists were more than 90% certain that most of global warming was being caused by increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases produced by human activities.[7][8][9] In 2010 that finding was recognized by the national science academies of all major industrialized nations.[10][a]</p>

<p>Affirming these findings in 2013, the IPCC stated that the largest driver of global warming is carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from fossil fuel combustion, cement production, and land use changes such as deforestation.[12] Its 2013 report states:</p>

    <p class="blockquote">Human influence has been detected in warming of the atmosphere and the ocean, in changes in the global water cycle, in reductions in snow and ice, in global mean sea level rise, and in changes in some climate extremes. This evidence for human influence has grown since AR4. It is extremely likely (95-100%) that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century. - IPCC AR5 WG1 Summary for Policymakers[13]</p>

<p>Climate model projections were summarized in the 2013 Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). They indicated that during the 21st century the global surface temperature is likely to rise a further 0.3 to 1.7 °C (0.5 to 3.1 °F) for their lowest emissions scenario using stringent mitigation and 2.6 to 4.8 °C (4.7 to 8.6 °F) for their highest.[14] The ranges of these estimates arise from the use of models with differing sensitivity to greenhouse gas concentrations.[15][16]</p>
