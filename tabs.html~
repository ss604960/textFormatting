<h1>Tabs</h1>
<div id="intro" class="instructions">
I've included below all the HTML you would need to create a set of links displayed as "tabs." To create the tab appearance as shown in the screenshot below, follow these steps:
	<ol>
		<li>Set the width of the tabContainer div to 30%</li>
		<li>Set the display property to inline-block for a tags in tabContainer</li>
		<li>Set the width of a tags in tabContainer to 22% (you'll need to add a section with the correct selector for this to the style section).</li>
		<li>Set the background-color of a tags in tabContainer to darkblue and the color to yellow</li>
		<li>Use the text-decoration rule to remove the underline from a tags in tabContainer. Look up the text-decoration rule on
		<li>Experiment with different values for border-top-left-radius and border-top-right-radius until you achieve the effect in the screenshot. Remember you can set 2 value rules for border-radius to create elliptical shapes.</li>
                <li>Experiment with margins and padding (you will probably want to set different left, right, top, and bottom values for these) until you achieve the pictured effect.</li>
	</ol> 
<p>Once the tabs are set up, try adding some different background-color rules to the #tabContainer a:hover section to change the color of the tab the user is hovering over. This will provide a nice effect to tell the user the tabs are a navigation element. Find a color that looks like it matches the existing elements.</p>
<p>Once you have replicated the pictured effect, try some other settings and see what other looks you can achieve for your tabs.</p>
